Lab Assignment 3 —  Graph Algorithms in Real-Life Applications

Overview

This project demonstrates the use of fundamental graph algorithms in real-world contexts, including social networks, navigation systems, disaster response, and infrastructure optimization.

It implements and analyzes four classical graph algorithms — BFS/DFS, Bellman-Ford, Dijkstra, and MST — to solve practical, real-life problems.

Implementation Details

Each problem includes:

Graph Modeling: Representation using adjacency lists or edge lists.

Algorithm Design: Efficient implementation using core Python data structures.

Profiling: Time and memory usage measurement using time and memory_profiler.

Visualization: Optional plots using matplotlib for time vs. nodes/edges.

Analysis: Complexity discussion and scalability commentary.

Reflections

Real-World Contexts Influence Algorithm Choice:
Each domain’s requirements directly map to the algorithm’s characteristics:

Social media → mutual links → BFS/DFS

Navigation with negative roads → Bellman-Ford

Disaster routing → positive weights → Dijkstra

Infrastructure → minimal cost connection → MST

Performance Profiling:
Execution times align with theoretical complexities:

BFS/DFS → Linear with V + E

Bellman-Ford → Increases linearly with E × V

Dijkstra → Faster for sparse graphs

MST → Efficient with min-heaps (O(E log V))
