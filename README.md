# ðŸš€ Algorithm Efficiency Mini Project
# Lab Assignment 1 â€” Analyzing and Visualizing Recursive Algorithm Efficiency

This project explores **algorithm efficiency** by implementing and analyzing:
- Fibonacci (Recursive & Iterative)
- Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick)
- Searching Algorithm (Binary Search - Iterative & Recursive)

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
algo-efficiency-mini-project-himanshi
- algo_analysis_notebook.ipynb â†’ Main notebook with code & analysis
- requirements.txt â†’ Dependencies
- README.md â†’ Documentation
- .gitignore â†’ Ignored files

ðŸ“Š Features
- Algorithm implementation in Python
- Profiling with time and memory_profiler
- Visualization with matplotlib
- Comparison of theoretical vs. experimental performance

ðŸ“ˆ Insights:-
- Recursive approaches are elegant but inefficient due to stack depth & exponential calls.
- Iterative approaches are more practical for large inputs.
- Sorting results matched expected complexities:
- Merge & Quick Sort â‰« Bubble/Selection/Insertion.
- Binary Search showed logarithmic efficiency but only works on sorted arrays.
